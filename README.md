# 🚗 Automobile Customer Intelligence Analysis
### *Optimizing Premium Mobility through Data-Driven Segmentation*

---

## 📌 Project Overview
In the luxury mobility sector, a one-size-fits-all approach limits growth. This project leverages **Unsupervised Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)** to analyze over 8,000 customer records. By identifying distinct behavioral archetypes, this analysis provides a roadmap for **AutoGirl.ng** to optimize fleet allocation, personalize marketing, and enhance the chauffeur-service experience.

## 💡 Business Insights & Strategic Impact
The model successfully identified four high-impact segments. Mapping these to the specific business model reveals immediate growth opportunities:

| Segment | Demographic Profile | Strategic Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Rising Gen-Z** | Avg. Age 27 | High potential for **Self-Drive** rentals. Ideal for social media-led brand awareness. |
| **Mid-Career Pros** | Avg. Age 41 | The "Sweet Spot" for **Monthly Leases** and long-term corporate partnerships. |
| **Established Executives** | Avg. Age 46 | Prime demographic for **Premium Chauffeur Services** and luxury transfers. |
| **Senior Statesmen** | Avg. Age 69 | High-trust segment. Focus on **Safety-First** marketing and highly-vetted "pilots." |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
* **Language:** Python 3.x (Google Colab Environment)
* **Key Libraries:** `Pandas`, `Scikit-Learn`, `Seaborn`, and `Matplotlib`.
* **Preprocessing:** Utilized `StandardScaler` to normalize features (Age vs. Work Experience), ensuring the algorithm weighted variables equally for maximum accuracy.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
* **Retention Modeling:** Integrate historical rental data to calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
* **Predictive Maintenance:** Develop an ML pipeline to forecast vehicle maintenance schedules.
* **Real-time Dashboard:** Deploy the model via **Streamlit** for real-time customer profiling.
